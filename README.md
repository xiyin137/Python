physics_research_tool.py is an app I created using Gemini 3 that organizes and keeps notes on ideas.
physics_research_tool_app.py compiles to an app that runs in macOS.

latticeYM3d-simulation.py and latticeYM3d-analysis.py performs the lattice Monte Carlo simulation of the 3D SU(2) pure Yang-Mills theory and evaluate the lightest glueball mass as well as the flux string tension.
