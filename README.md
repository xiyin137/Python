physics_research_tool.py is an app that organizes and keeps notes. physics_research_tool_app.py compiles to an app that runs in macOS.

latticeYM3d-simulation.py and latticeYM3d-analysis.py perform the lattice Monte Carlo simulation of the 3D SU(2) pure Yang-Mills theory and evaluate the lightest glueball mass as well as the flux string tension.

ising3d.py performs the Monte Carlo simulation of the 3D Ising model, determines the critical temperature and extracts the critical exponent associated with the spin field.
